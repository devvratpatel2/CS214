Some of the problems i faced during the assignment eas to figure out was to how to search a directory to find a csv file. 

Anyways, my code can sort multiple csv files with ease. I used the provided data file to check my code. My code works recursively and checks every file in that filder. using a while loop. 

It will output the total process inculding all child process and greatest parent process.

This is how my code works.
First i created a struct array. All struckts include a row and a string array. The string store the value of fiels. Since some are blank, i nclude black space at the beginning. I store the string values on the fields and then returned. In the end if it existed i compare specific field type in each struck and change order.
My header file has all headers required.
