E,F: Two more workloads of your choosing

	Both the test cases will run for 100 iterations and the average time will be shown at the end.
        
E.  In the first  test case, pick any random number of bytes ranging from 2 to 64. Now, malloc until you can and 
	once we are done with that, free every other pointer so : 0, 2, 4 ......
	Now pick another number that will fit in the free space without splitting to occur and re malloc the same freed 
	pointers. Once that is done, free all the nodes. 
	The range is only 2-64 as if we get 1, then 1-0 will 0 and that will cause an error.

        
F.	In this test case, pick any random number of bytes ranging from 10-64. Now, malloc until you can and 
	once we are done with that, free every other pointer so : 0, 2, 4 ....
	Now pick another number that will fit in the free space without splitting to occur and re malloc the same freed pointers. Once that is dine, free all the nodes.
